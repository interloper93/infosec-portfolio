# Hi, I'm Dan 👋

I’m making the deep-dive from **slinging bandaids to discovering vulnerabilities**, all with the aim of helping others.  

For the past **nine years**, I’ve served as an **EMT 🚑** across county 911, private ambulance services, search and rescue, and FEMA/DHS disaster response teams. In those high-pressure roles, I developed resilience, problem-solving, and teamwork skills — qualities I now bring into **cybersecurity** as I pursue a career in **penetration testing and red teaming⚔️**.

This repo is where you’ll find my **tools, writeups, and labs** as I document the journey.
